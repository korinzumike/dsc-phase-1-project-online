## In this Git Repository, you will find the following Jupyter Notebook file:

[https://github.com/korinzumike/dsc-phase-1-project-online/blob/master/collins_project1_workbook.ipynb](https://github.com/korinzumike/dsc-phase-1-project-online/blob/master/collins_project1_workbook.ipynb)

This Jupyter Notebook has 3 important cells:



*   The first cell loads US Consumer Price Index information from the website: [https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Consumer_Price_Index/HistoricalCPI.aspx?reloaded=true](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Consumer_Price_Index/HistoricalCPI.aspx?reloaded=true)
*   The second cell downloads approximately 10 Megabytes of information from the website [https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all) (plus its 60 continuation pages), and the pages [https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1977](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1977) through [https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-2020](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-2020) .
*   The third cell turns the movie-related data into a pandas dataframe.  Graphs of the movie-related data are produced in the output portion of the cell.  The same graphs are written as PNG files to the same directory in which the file collins_project1_workbook.ipynb resides.


## In this Git Repository, you will find the following Slide Presentation:

[https://github.com/korinzumike/dsc-phase-1-project-online/blob/master/Slides/Collins_Project1_Slides.pdf](https://github.com/korinzumike/dsc-phase-1-project-online/blob/master/Slides/Collins_Project1_Slides.pdf)

This slide presentation (slide deck) contains 13 color slides, in which the graphs generated by collins_project1_workbook.ipynb are considered in detail.


## In this Git Repository, you will find the following folder full of Graphs:

[https://github.com/korinzumike/dsc-phase-1-project-online/tree/master/Graphs](https://github.com/korinzumike/dsc-phase-1-project-online/tree/master/Graphs)

In this folder are previously-generated versions of the graphs that would otherwise be generated by collins_project1_workbook.ipynb.  These graphs are provided as a courtesy to those who are unable to run the Jupyter Notebook and generate the graphs directly.
